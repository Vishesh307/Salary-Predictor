# Salary-Predictor
Developed a Salary Predictor using Simple Linear Regression by analyzing the given data set.
The predictor would suggest the salary of the employee based on the years of experience as input.

This was my first personal project in Machine Learning where I used the python libraries for the first time which were new to my knowledge. This project made me comfortable in using the Jupyter Notebook platform.
